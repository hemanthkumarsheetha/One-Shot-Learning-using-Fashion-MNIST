# One-Shot-Learning-using-Fashion-MNIST-Tensorflow
This is my One Shot Learning implementation of Fashion MNIST Dataset

- In this Implementation, I've created a dataset with pairs and labels from the original dataset.
- A pair is assigned a label of 1 if both the images are of the same class.
- A pair is assigned a label of 0 if both the images are of different classes.
- This is one of the implementations of Meta Learning Technique called Few Shot Learning.
